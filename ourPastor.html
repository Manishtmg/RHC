                        <h1>Ezekiel Monger</h1>
                        <p>Pastor Ezekiel Monger’s journey began with a deep calling to serve God and his community. Growing up in a small village, Ezekiel was always drawn to the teachings of the Bible and the message of hope it brings. As he matured, he felt a profound desire to deepen his understanding of God’s Word and pursue ministry as a lifelong mission.

                            Determined to follow his calling, Ezekiel enrolled in a respected Bible school, where he spent years studying theology, pastoral care, and community leadership. Through rigorous training and spiritual growth, he developed a passion for sharing the love of Christ with people from all walks of life. His time in Bible school shaped his vision to build a welcoming space where faith, culture, and community come together.
                            
                            Now, Pastor Ezekiel is ready to fulfill his vision by establishing Redemption Hill Nepali Church. His mission is to create a church that embraces Nepali heritage while spreading the message of hope and salvation through Jesus Christ. He believes that faith should not only transform individuals but also strengthen the bonds of family and community.
                            
                            With a heart full of compassion and a steadfast commitment to his faith, Pastor Ezekiel invites everyone to join him on this journey of spiritual growth, fellowship, and service. His dream is to build a church that feels like home — a place where lives are changed, and God’s love is experienced every day.</p>
